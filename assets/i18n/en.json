The goal is to provide gardeners with affordable access to expert advice on what types and amounts of fertilizers (both natural and chemical) are needed to overcome the reported problem. The agronomists, on the other hand, are able to earn money remotely via this platform. The platform is aimed to solve the lack of communication between gardeners and industry specialists, overcoming the existing logistical problems.",
